Privacy Policy

This extension does not collect, store, or transmit personal data.

The extension runs only on coachless.gg and api.coachless.gg to capture build request payloads locally in the browser for one purpose: converting build data into a League of Legends item set JSON file for download.

All processing happens locally in the user's browser.

No data is sent to external servers.
No analytics, tracking, or advertising is used.
